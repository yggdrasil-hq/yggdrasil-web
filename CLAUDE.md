# CLAUDE.md — Web (Yggdrasil Web)

> Canonical agent guide for this repo. `AGENTS.md` is a thin pointer to this
> file. This repo is a **git submodule** of the Yggdrasil meta repo.

## Context discipline (read first)

1. This router is short on purpose. Find your task in the routing table and open
   **only** the doc(s) it points to.
2. Each doc starts with `**Read this when:**` — use it to decide before reading.
3. For **suite-wide** context (product, architecture, glossary, cross-component
   contracts), don't restate it here — follow the up-links to the meta repo.

## What this repo is

The daily user surface for Yggdrasil. Users create projects, write feature specs,
monitor agent runs live, review test reports, and chat with or steer the agent
mid-run. Holds **no** source-of-truth state — everything comes from the API.

- **Role in Yggdrasil:** Web
- **Stack:** React / Next.js (planned), desktop-first responsive
- **Talks to:** API REST (commands/queries), API WebSocket (live run events). Never talks to the Orchestrator directly.

## Suite-wide context (up-links to the meta repo)

> These resolve when this repo is checked out inside the Yggdrasil meta repo.

- Product & scope: `../docs/overview/product.md`
- Architecture / data flow: `../docs/overview/architecture.md`
- Glossary: `../docs/overview/glossary.md`
- This component's bridge page: `../docs/components/web.md`
- Roadmap & open questions: `../docs/roadmap/`

## Routing table (this repo)

| If your task is about…        | Read                          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Authentication / login UI / middleware | Meta: `../docs/concepts/authentication.md` → `docs/concepts/authentication.md` |
| Orientation / how it's built  | `docs/overview/architecture.md` |
| Local dev / setup             | `docs/overview/setup.md`      |
| Conventions specific to here  | `docs/conventions/`           |

Full index: `docs/README.md`.

## Standing rules

- Keep docs in sync with code in the same change.
- One concern per doc; route, don't dump. (See the meta repo's
  `../docs/conventions/documentation-guide.md`.)
- Suite-wide facts live in the meta repo — link up, don't copy.
