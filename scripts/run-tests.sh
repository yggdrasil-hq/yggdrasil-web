# Issue #102: state which tree this run is looking at.
#
# `docker-compose.test.yml` mounts the source read-only, so an edit is always what
# runs — this prints the note that lets a reader of a log *confirm* that. It
# answers the one question a test log otherwise cannot: did this run see the change
# that was just made, or a build from before it? A digest, because the identity of
# a tree should be comparable between runs — including a run in CI, where nobody is
# watching and the log is read later.
#
# The directories are the ones holding code the suite exercises; they are a subset
# of the compose file's mounts, which also cover `public/`, `scripts/` and the root
# config files. Deliberately hashing only these: an identity that moved because a
# static asset changed would be noise, and the point is to identify the code.
#
# Guarded with `command -v` and a fallback, and every substitution is `|| echo`-safe,
# because a reporting line must never be able to fail the suite it is reporting on.
